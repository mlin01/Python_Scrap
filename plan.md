# Web Scraper Project Plan

## Project Overview
Develop a universal web scraper capable of scraping content from any website, including those with advanced anti-scraping measures such as CAPTCHAs, rate limiting, IP blocking, and JavaScript-based protections.

## Objectives
- Create a flexible, robust scraper that can handle diverse website structures
- Implement comprehensive anti-scraping bypass techniques
- Provide easy-to-use interface for data extraction
- Ensure scalability and maintainability

## Key Features
- **Universal Compatibility**: Scrape static and dynamic websites
- **Anti-Scraping Measures**:
  - User-Agent rotation
  - Proxy rotation (free and paid proxies)
  - Rate limiting and request delays
  - CAPTCHA solving integration
  - Cookie and session management
  - Referer and header spoofing
  - JavaScript rendering support
- **Data Extraction**: Support for HTML parsing, JSON APIs, and custom selectors
- **Output Formats**: JSON, CSV, XML
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and logging
- **Configuration**: Easy setup via config files or CLI

## Architecture
- **Core Framework**: Scrapy for structured crawling
- **Dynamic Content**: Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **HTTP Requests**: Requests library for simple scraping
- **Parsing**: BeautifulSoup and lxml for HTML/XML processing
- **Anti-Scraping Middleware**:
  - Proxy middleware
  - User-Agent middleware
  - Delay middleware
  - CAPTCHA solving middleware

## Components
1. **Scraper Engine**: Main crawling logic
2. **Proxy Manager**: Handle proxy rotation and validation
3. **User-Agent Rotator**: Rotate browser fingerprints
4. **CAPTCHA Solver**: Integrate with solving services
5. **Data Extractor**: Parse and extract structured data
6. **Storage Manager**: Handle data persistence
7. **Configuration Manager**: Load and manage settings
8. **Logger**: Comprehensive logging system

## Technologies
- Python 3.11+
- Scrapy 2.13+
- Selenium 4.35+
- BeautifulSoup 4.13+
- Requests 2.32+
- Additional libraries: lxml, html5lib, cryptography

## Implementation Strategy
1. Set up project structure and virtual environment
2. Implement basic scraper functionality
3. Add anti-scraping features incrementally
4. Test on various website types
5. Optimize performance and reliability
6. Add monitoring and maintenance features

## Risk Mitigation
- Handle common blocking scenarios
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Use ethical scraping practices (respect robots.txt)
- Monitor for legal compliance

## Success Criteria
- Successfully scrape content from 90%+ of target websites
- Handle major anti-scraping techniques
- Maintain <5% failure rate on non-blocked sites
- Process requests at configurable rates without detection</content>
